"""Shared human-readable hints for ST refresh reason codes.

The reason codes are produced by ``TokenManager._try_refresh_st`` (and its helpers)
and stored in ``TokenManager._last_st_refresh_reason``. They are consumed by the
manual ``/api/tokens/{id}/refresh-at`` endpoint (to surface a friendly toast) and
by the ST-only refresh scheduler (to surface a friendly warning log line).

Keeping a single source of truth here ensures both surfaces use identical wording.
